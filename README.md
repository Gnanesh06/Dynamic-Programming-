You have been given a gold mine represented by a 2-d matrix of size ('N' * 
'M') 'N' rows and 'M' columns. Each field/cell in this mine contains a positive 
integer, the amount of gold in kgs.
Initially, the miner is at the first column but can be at any row.
He can move only right, right up, or right down. That is from a given cell and 
the miner can move to the cell diagonally up towards the right or right or 
diagonallydown towards the right.
Find out the maximum amount of gold he can collect.
